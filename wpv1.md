# Curb
Curb is an easy to use crypto-based marketplace for finding available parking at low rates.

# Introduction
Curb was created for the future of the automotive industry. Imagine a world where locating a parking space can be done before you arrive at a lower price than conventional parking. With Curb, this is possible. Curb works with owners of Parking Lots & Garages as well as the everyday driver. Using Curb allows for lot owners, companies, and more to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment for parking to provide cheaper space.

# Mission
Curbs goal is to nearly half the average cost of paid parking by allowing any company to accept cryptocurrency in exchange for space.

# Future 
Using Smart Contracts thanks to the Ethereum blockchain, Curb will allow for users to make agreements on short-term and long-term parking deals within seconds. This allows for the safety and security for the seller, as well as the buyer. 

Blockchain technology is only in its beginning stage with it mainly being used for financial services, current predictions state

  - "2021 is shaping up to be the year that, across the board, blockchain moves into the mainstream and a much wider range of economic sectors. Healthcare, transportation, and logistics are just a few of the areas that may benefit from wider blockchain adoption and implementation." (https://bit.ly/3nKQmjR)

Curbs future plans on integrating this new model includes servicing large events, colleges and universities

# Curb Coin
Curb will use Bitcoin (Stage 1) and CurbCoin (CURB) [Future Use] to complete transactions on the Marketplace

- Curb Coin will be a token built on the Ethereum blockchain and be used for transactions with Curb.

Curb and CurbCoin will be separate entities

  - CurbCoin is a free to use, open-source project.

CurbCoins goal is to be "the currency of the automotive industry"

# Business Model

Curb makes it easy to understand the model of monetization

-  For each transaction between space buyer (x) and seller (x), Curb takes 10% commission of the final price of the contract.
