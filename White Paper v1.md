# Curb
Curb is an easy to use crypto marketplace for finding available parking at extreme low rates

# Introduction
Curb was created for the future of the automotive industry. Imagine a world where locating a parking space can be done before you arrive. With Curb, this is possible. Curb works with owners of Parking Lots & Garages as well as the everyday human. Using Curb allows for lot owners, companies, and more to accept cryptocurrency as a form as payment for parking to provide cheaper space.

# Mission
Curbs goal is to nearly half the average cost of paid parking by allowing any company to accept cryptocurrency in exchange for space.

# A Bright Future
Using Smart Contracts thanks to the Ethereum blockchain, Curb will allow for users to make agreements on short-term and long-term parking deals within seconds. This allows for the safety and security for the seller, as well as the buyer. 

Blockchain technology is only in its beggining stage with it mainly being used for financial services, current predictions state

  - "2021 is shaping up to be the year that, across the board, blockchain moves into the mainstream and a much wider range of economic sectors. Healthcare, transportation, and logistics are just a few of the areas that may benefit from wider blockchain adoption and implementation." (https://bit.ly/3nKQmjR)
