# Curb
Curb is a Decentralized Peer to Peer Network for finding available parking

# Introduction
Curb was created for the future of Automobile Travel. Imagine a world where you tell your car where to go and which spot to park in from its starting point. With Curb, this is possible. Curb works with owners of Parking Lots & Garages as well as the everyday human. Using Curb allows anyone to list their driveway, street parking spot, or apartment parking space available on the Curb Marketplace.

# Mission
Curbs goal is to disrupt the current $9.1bn parking and garage industry. By allowing virtually anyone to list their parking spot when its not in use, Curb can decrease the current cost of paid parking up to 5x, making it extremely affordable for everyone.
